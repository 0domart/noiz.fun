# 🎧 noiz.fun – Make some Noiz

**noiz.fun** is a playful, mobile-first sound playground built for Solana.

Users can create short audio clips, like others' creations, and earn points in a gamified experience. Think of it as TikTok + Bangers + Tinder, but for short sounds only.

Built for the [Solana Mobile Hackathon](https://solanamobile.com/hackathon), powered by Ferno.
